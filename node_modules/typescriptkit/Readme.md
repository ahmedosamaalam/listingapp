# TypeScriptKit
A typescript library with utilities I caught myself making over and over again.

## Using the library
To install the library just use:  
`npm install --save typescriptkit`  
And install the latest version.  


You will get the entire library in .ts files, the bundeling is completely up to you so you can exclusively include the files you need.  
For bundeling the library I recommend using webpack either in gulp or plain webpack and use systemjs module resolution  
and use webpack to bundle the files for you in the typescript compile task.  
This means you can use for example:  
`  import { InstanceHelper } from 'typescriptkit';`  
`  import { StringHelper } from 'typescriptkit';`
